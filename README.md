Magic The Gathering Championship
=====

For years we have held a [Magic The Gathering](http://magic.wizards.com/) [Sealed Deck Championship](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Sealed_deck) at [MAPS](www.maps.com.br).

An important -and, for a while, quite secretive- part of the championship is the card pool that each of the competitors got.

This project aims at raising the level of competition further by making it public what everyone got in their pools -so you can prepare thoroughly before the eminent battles.

This was written in order to become more familiar with [MeteorJS](https://www.meteor.com/), an open source JavaScript web framework.

Under the hood it uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Backbone.js](http://backbonjs.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).
