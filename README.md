Magic The Gathering Championship
=====

For years we have held a [Magic The Gathering](http://magic.wizards.com/) [Sealed Deck Championship](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Sealed_deck) at [MAPS](www.maps.com.br).

This project aims at raising the level of competition further by making it public what everyone got in their pools -so you can prepare thoroughly before the eminent battles.

An important -and, for a while, quite secrettive- part of the championhip is the card pool that each of the competitors got.
